# Contributing to easyci development

The goal of this guide is to help you get up and contributing to easyci 
as quickly as possible. It's still a work in progress and very rough. 
Your feedback is much appreciated and so are pull requests :).

To contribute a change to easyci, you follow these steps:

1. Set up a local easyci development environment.
1. Create a branch in git and make your changes.
1. Push branch to github and issue pull request (PR).
1. Discuss the pull request.
1. Iterate until either we accept the PR or decide that it's not
   a good fit for easyci.
